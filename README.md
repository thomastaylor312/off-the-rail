# Off the Rail

An open source, standalone application for managing horse shows. This project is currently in
development and not ready for use. If you're interested in helping out before I release for general
use, please open an issue!

## Why does this exist?

One of my side gigs is working as a horse photographer because my wife owns a horse. Over that time,
I've seen a lot of different ways that people manage their shows. Some use spreadsheets, some use
paper, some use expensive platforms that charge per rider and show, and some use a combination of
all of the above. There isn't a ton of technical literacy or innovation in the horse world, so I
figured I'd try to build something that people could use. Plus, I wanted to give
[Tauri](https://tauri.app) a try since I write a lot of Rust and needed to polish up my front end
skills

## Roadmap

You can take a look at the code to see the basic scaffolding of what the app will look like. For the
first pass, this will be entirely local, meaning that the data will all be on your computer. After I
get the first pass done, I'll look into adding a server component so that you can sync your data
across devices.
